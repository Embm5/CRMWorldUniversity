### Database Creation

First connect with postgres user or another user with superuser privileges, then in Login/Group roles, create new Login/Group

![Create User](views/img/step1.png)

the user name is "CRMWU", in Definition put the password "1234" and configure the privileges.git

![Admin User Name](views/img/step2.png)
![Admin User Password](views/img/step3.png)

![User Privileges](views/img/step4.png)

once the user has been created, proceed to register a new server wiht the name "CRMWU_DB"

![New server](views/img/step5.png)

![Register - Server](views/img/step6.png)

In connection configure the hostname, in username place the user previously created and the password

### Sequelize synchronization

As the project is running in a local environment, it is required to manually synchronize the data used in the system, such as users, categories, products, etc.
This action only needs to be performed once!

1. First, in a terminal, located in the project's main folder, execute `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2. Located in the project's main folder, execute `npm run sync` to synchronize all models in the database and insert all used data

---

### Starting the project

If you have already performed the steps above, you can initialize the project by running `npm start` located in the root folder of the project. You can then view the project with any browser by visiting
http://localhost:4200/

# Construction details
The system follows a three-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database).

- Frontend: A web application that directly interacts with users (students, admin, staff and teacher).
- Backend: A REST API that processes requests and manages business logic.
- Database: A relational database to store information about students, admin, staff and teacher.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Angular  

Backend
- **Language**: Node.js with Express

Database
- **Relational database**: PostgreSQL
